The shoot was all about capturing the beauty of craftsmanship — the textures, the focus, the joy of making something by hand. It became a blend of design and storytelling, where creativity met precision. We loved bringing to life the warm, authentic atmosphere of a space where imagination truly takes shape.",

          "text": "For Steel & Barnett, we produced a fully custom company video designed to clearly communicate the brand’s story, values, and craftsmanship. The goal was to create an informative yet engaging film that could be used as a powerful sales and communication tool.\n\nTo capture every aspect of the brand, the production was spread across four separate shoots. We started with a studio shoot focused entirely on the jewelry itself, highlighting the details, materials, and presentation options. This was complemented by an on-location shoot at the Steel & Barnett office, offering insight into the team and daily brand experience.\n\nTo showcase the production process, we coordinated a shoot in Hong Kong by sourcing and directing a local videographer, ensuring the footage aligned seamlessly with the rest of the production. A dedicated campaign shoot was also included to capture lifestyle and in-use visuals, enriching the video with dynamic and relatable content.\n\nThe final video was distributed to clients via PixieCards and quickly proved its value. After sending out over 500 cards, Steel & Barnett achieved a positive return on investment and is continuing the campaign by distributing more cards to turn clients into long-term brand ambassadors.\n\nTo support their international audience, the company video was delivered in three voice-over versions: UK English, US English, and German—ensuring consistent messaging across multiple markets.",
